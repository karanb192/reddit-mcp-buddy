## ⚠️ API Reality Check - Platforms to Avoid

**These platforms seem attractive but have severe API limitations:**

1. **LinkedIn** - API is basically useless (only OAuth and sharing)
2. **Instagram** - Extremely limited API, anti-automation
3. **TikTok** - Very restrictive API, mostly for advertisers
4. **Facebook** - API heavily restricted after Cambridge Analytica
5. **WhatsApp** - Business API only, very limited
6. **Pinterest** - API is read-only and very limited
7. **Snapchat** - Almost no public API access
8. **Airbnb** - No public API, aggressive anti-scraping

**Platforms with GREAT APIs to focus on:**
- ✅ YouTube, Spotify, Discord, Slack, GitHub
- ✅ Stack Overflow, Hacker News, Reddit
- ✅ Notion, Airtable, Google Workspace
- ✅ Stripe, Shopify (for e-commerce)

## Secret Sauce for Virality

1. **Pick a platform people check daily** (not occasionally)
2. **Solve a problem they didn't know could be solved** ("Wait, I can do THAT?")
3. **Make the first experience magical** (one-click, instant value)
4. **Give it a friendly name** (Buddy, Studio, Genius, Commander)
5. **Launch with one mind-blowing use case** (focus!)
6. **Document like you're teaching your mom** (clarity wins)
7. **Add social proof fast** (stars, testimonials, badges)

## Next Steps
1. Pick ONE idea (don't build multiple)
2. Validate API access and limits
3. Build MVP with ONE killer feature
4. Copy Reddit MCP Buddy's structure
5. Launch in relevant communities
6. Iterate based on feedback

Remember: **Execution > Idea**. Reddit MCP Buddy won not because it was first, but because it was BEST executed.
